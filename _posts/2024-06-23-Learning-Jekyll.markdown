# Learning Jekyll

So far, this has been a fun time. I’ve tried learning Jekyll before, but that was before I got into vim and lisp, and before I had a solid goal. Now, I know what I want to do with Jekyll, which should help me stay on track to actually finish learning, especially because this project is for a special someone.

# Tutorials

I’ve been using this [tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#writing-pages-and-posts-); It’s pretty good, even though it is a bit outdated. Once I feel like I’ve got the hang of it, I want to move on to learning to use the [Ed.](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/) theme, which I really like. I don’t think it’s that different from standard Jekyll, but I know that it does have some special features.
